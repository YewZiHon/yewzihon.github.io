# Zi Hon's Portfolio

Hey, I'm Yew Zi Hon. I am a mechatronics and robotics engineering graduate.
  
## About me

My interests are 3D printing, CNC machining and electric discharge machining. I have done some of my own projects and learnt many things. 
I am currently in the SP makers CCA. 

## Projects

### Final Year Project
  
My team is designing and prototyping an autonomous guided vehicle.

### Electric discharge machining
  
Exploring electric discharge machining (EDM) is a personal project. I have experimented with a drill/sinker EDM.
