# Zi Hon's Portfolio

Hey, I'm Yew Zi Hon. I am a diploma graduate for mechatronics and robotics engineering. I am currently studying Mechanical engineering in Nanyang Techonological University.
  
## About me

My interests are 3D printing, CNC machining and electric discharge machining. I have done some of my own projects and learnt many things.

## Projects

### piano player
  
This project is a personal project that I worked on. It uses servo motors to press down on the piano keys. Motors are driven by a pwm driver and controlled by a micro  controller.

### LED sign
  
The LED sign was a CCA project assigned to us. Neopixel LEDs were used to light up the sign and provide various lighting   effects.
